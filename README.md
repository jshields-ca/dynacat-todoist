# dynacat-todoist

Connect your Todoist productivity stats to your [Dynacat](https://github.com/Panonim/dynacat) self-hosted dashboard.

A single `custom-api` widget that shows karma, task stats, priority breakdown, labels, and projects — all in one place. No extra server required; Dynacat fetches the Todoist API directly.

---

## What It Shows

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Karma** | Current score with up/down trend indicator |
| **Completed today** | Tasks done today vs. your daily goal |
| **All-time completed** | Total tasks completed across all time |
| **Open tasks** | Total count with priority breakdown (urgent / high / medium / normal) |
| **Labels** | Top 5 labels by frequency across open tasks, sorted highest count first, each showing a usage count |
| **Projects** | All project names as compact badges, with total project count |
| **View Tasks on Todoist** | Subdued link to the Todoist app (fades in on hover) |

---

## Setup

### 1. Get your Todoist API token

1. Log in to [Todoist](https://todoist.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Developer**
3. Copy your **API token**

### 2. Add the token to your Dynacat `.env` file

```env
TODOIST_API_TOKEN=your_personal_api_token_here
```

### 3. Add the widget to your Dynacat `config.yml`

Copy the full widget block from `widgets/todoist-dashboard.yml` and paste it into a column's `widgets:` list:

```yaml
pages:
  - name: Home
    columns:
      - size: small
        widgets:
          # paste contents of widgets/todoist-dashboard.yml here
```

### 4. Restart Dynacat

```bash
# Docker
docker compose restart

# Binary
systemctl restart dynacat
```

---

## Caching

The widget defaults to `cache: 15m`. Change it to suit your needs. Use `cache: 1s` while developing to see changes without restarting Dynacat.

---

## API Fields Reference

The widget uses three Todoist API v1 endpoints. All fields are guarded with `.Exists` checks so the widget degrades gracefully if a field is absent.

| Field | Endpoint | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `karma` | `/user` | Integer karma score |
| `karma_trend` | `/user` | `"up"` or `"down"` — shown as arrow |
| `completed_today` | `/user` | Tasks completed today |
| `daily_goal` | `/user` | Daily task goal target |
| `completed_count` | `/user` | All-time completed count |
| `karma_completed_count` | `/user` | Fallback for all-time count |
| `priority` | `/tasks` | 4 = urgent, 3 = high, 2 = medium, 1 = normal |
| `labels` | `/tasks` | Array of label strings per task |
| `name` | `/projects` | Project name |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Widget shows no content / blank

1. Confirm `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` is set in your Dynacat `.env`
2. Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
3. Test the API directly:
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/user | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

### Labels section not showing

Labels only appear if at least one open task has a label assigned. If all your open tasks are unlabelled, the section is hidden automatically.

### Streaks not showing

Streak data (current streak, best streak) is **not exposed by Todoist API v1**. It is only visible inside the Todoist app under the Productivity section. This is a Todoist API limitation — not a widget bug. If Todoist ever adds streak fields to the API, the widget will display them automatically since it uses `.Exists` guards throughout.

### Per-project task counts not showing

The `/tasks` endpoint does not return a `project_id` field that can be reliably matched against project IDs from the `/projects` endpoint in Go templates. Projects are shown as name badges only.
